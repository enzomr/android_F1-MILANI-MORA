## FumberNacts

FumberNacts is an android application that displays facts on various numbers using NumbersAPI (http://numbersapi.com/).

The first screen contains two buttons, each starting a new activity containing a list to display some math facts or some trivias using a recycler view.
It also contains a date picker, which when updated shows a fact concerning the chosen date.
Finally, it contains a random fact that changes every few seconds, using a coroutine.
